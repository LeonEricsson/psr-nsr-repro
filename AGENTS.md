# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation
This repository is built entirely on [verl: Volcano Engine Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). 

- 

- `/verl`: Source code from the verl repository containing everything pertaining to training (models, RL algorithms, ...).
- `/data`: Data to use for experiments
- `/examples`: Example run bash scrips, data preprocessing, ...


## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- Use TypeScript for all new code generated by OpenAI Codex
- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output
- OpenAI Codex should generally adhere to the Google Python Style Guide, but this is a research repository,
not production code, the focus is fast iteration, and experiment results, not long term code maintainability.
- OpenAI Codex should write docstrings for functions if they contain non-obvious logic. 
- OpenAI Codex should write inline comments only for tricky parts of the code. Complicated operations 
get a few lines of comments before the operations commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the line.

## Testing Requirements for OpenAI Codex

Test for compilation. No other tests unless explicitly asked for by the user.

## Programmatic Checks for OpenAI Codex
